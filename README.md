# Contributors
For anyone looking to contribute to the codebase, it's very encouraged! Primarily contribution entails adding your own pose checkers to the module. Any other spots for improvement should be made as seperate pull requests and not bundled in with a pose checker addition.

## Adding a new pose checker
A pose checker is a function which when called on a `PosenetObjectWrapper` instance returns true or false depending whether the pose is correct in Yoga terms. These pose checker functions are created as functions of an instance of a `PoseCheckerConstructor` derived classes. A `PosenetObjectWrapper` is simply a Posenet wrapped up in something which gives it an intuitive `bodypart` interface.

 Confused? Take a look at the example for WARRIORTWO. The `WarriorTwoCheckerConstructor` class re-writes the implementation of `checker()` (which it inherets from the parent class) to be a method which determines whether a `wrappedPosenetObject` passed to it is the Yoga pose *Warrior Two* or not. It does this by using a number of HELPER FUNCTIONS passed down through it's parent class, `PoseCheckerConstructor`. The checker is then exported with the use of `createBoundChecker()`; a static class method which creates an instance of `WarriorTwoCheckerConstructor`, binds `checker()` to said instance, and returns the checker function by itself. Thus we end up with a bound `checker()` for Warrior Two, with all it's underlying logic encapsulated away.

### Implementation Overview

 Almost all of this is pre-provided, so adding a new pose checker primarily consists of **developing a new implementation for `checker()` which determines true or false for your chosen pose.**

Creating a new pose checker function consists of the following steps:
- creating the file and Extending the class
- creating unit tests / sample data for your checker (you can do the next step first if you aren't a TDD fan)
- implementing your checker
- adding it to the main Pose

All pose checker functions are created by `CheckerConstructor` classes. To add a pose, create a new `CheckerConstructor` class in `/lib/pose_checkers` which extends the class `PoseCheckerConstructor`, found in `/lib/pose_checkers/pose_checker_constructor.js`.

- An easy to use template can be found in `/contributor_resources/template_checker_constructor.js`, but note that **the file must be copied to the correct directory**.

Change the `Template` in `TemplateCheckerConstructor` to the name of the yoga pose you have chosen. Naming convention follows javascript's XXXXX case for class names.

Change the contents of the `checker` function to implement your pose checks, making sure your function's output is in-keeping with convention, and your pose is ready to be imported into `Pose`! Nice!

There are a number of helpers to make implementing your pose easier, so make sure to read the section on BODYPART and POSECHECKERCONSTRUCTOR helper methods, and take a look at some of the pre-existing `CheckerCondtructors` to get you started.

## Implementation Convention
Checker methods must return the form of XXXXXXX.

### `bodypart(bodypartName)`
`bodypart` is a handy wrapper which makes it easy to make calls to the original Posenet object for the position hashes of different body parts.

#### Typical usage
```
wrappedPosenetObject.bodypart("nose").position
 => {x:55, y:97}
```
#### Implementation
In the scope of writing a `checker()` function, `bodypart` is callable on the wrappedPosenetObject. an Example from `/lib/pose_checkers/warrior_two.js`:
```
class WarriorTwoCheckerConstructor extends PoseCheckerConstructor {
  checker(wrappedPosenetObject){
    const criteria_1 = "Arms parallel to the ground";
    const check_1 = this._isHorizontal(
      [
        wrappedPosenetObject.bodypart("rightWrist").position,
        wrappedPosenetObject.bodypart("rightElbow").position,
        wrappedPosenetObject.bodypart("rightShoulder").position,
        wrappedPosenetObject.bodypart("leftShoulder").position,
        wrappedPosenetObject.bodypart("leftElbow").position,
        wrappedPosenetObject.bodypart("leftWrist").position
      ],
      15
    );
    ...
```
#### List of `bodypartName`s
```
"nose"
"leftEye"
"rightEye"
"leftEar"
"rightEar"
"leftShoulder"
"rightShoulder"
"leftElbow"
"rightElbow"
"leftWrist"
"rightWrist"
"leftHip"
"rightHip"
"leftKnee"
"rightKnee"
"leftAnkle"
"rightAnkle"
```

### `PoseCheckerConstructor` helper methods
All methods extended from the `PoseCheckerConstructor` class to help build checker functions.
#### `_isPointBetween(point, boundary)`
- **Returns `true` or `false` if `point` is between values in  `boundary`**


| Arg        | description           | example  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| `point`      | *number, one dimensional co-ordinate* | `5` |
| `boundary`      | *array of length two, describes boundaries* |   `[3,7]` |
```
//Example Usage
this._isPointBetween(5, [3,7])
  => true

this._isPointBetween(3, [5,7])
  => false
```
#### `_calculateAngle(edge1, middle, edge2)`
- **Returns angle in degrees of `edge1`->`middle`->`edge2`**


| Arg        | description           | example  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| `edge1`      | *position hash, first exterior point of angle* | `{x: 12, y: 5}` |
| `middle`      | *position hash, position of point angle is about* |   `{x: 0, y: 0}` |
| `edge2`      | *position hash, second exterior point of angle* |   `{x: 12, y: 0}` |
```

  0.7
  )
  => false
```
#### `_isStacked(points, margin)`

  0.7
  )
  => false
```

#### `_isStraight(points, margin)`
- **Only use this method if a solution cannot be reached with `_isHorizontal` or `_isStacked`, as it's more computationally consumptive.**
